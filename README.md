# liri-node-app
LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface.   LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.

LIRI was originally a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data, but we improved the user interface so that it is clear to any users which commands Liri can receive.
